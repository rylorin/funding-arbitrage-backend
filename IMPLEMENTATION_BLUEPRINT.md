## üìù Notes & Recommendations

### **Architecture Decisions**:

1. **Microservices vs Monolith**
   - Current: Monolithic architecture
   - Recommendation: Keep monolithic for now, plan for microservices if scaling issues arise
   - Rationale: Simpler deployment, easier debugging, sufficient for current scale

2. **Database Choice**
   - Current: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
   - Recommendation: Continue with PostgreSQL, consider TimescaleDB for time-series data
   - Rationale: Excellent for relational data, good performance, mature ecosystem

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Recommendation: Implement Redis for:
     - Funding rate caching (1-minute TTL)
     - User session management
     - Rate limiting counters
     - WebSocket connection state

4. **Message Queue**
   - Recommendation: Add RabbitMQ or Redis Pub/Sub for:
     - Background job queuing
     - Event-driven architecture
     - Decoupling services

### **Development Best Practices**:

1. **Code Review Process**
   - All PRs require review
   - Automated checks (linting, tests, security)
   - Documentation updates required

2. **Git Workflow**
   - Feature branches from `develop`
   - Semantic versioning for releases
   - Changelog maintenance

3. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Automated rollback capability
   - Canary releases for major changes
